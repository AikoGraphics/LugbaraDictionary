Introduction:
This machine translation tool was created painstakingly from scratch (zero) with gritty nerves on the 3rd Agofe's 90th birthday afternoon (Saturday 26th November 2016) after a South Sudanese Acholi-Madi in Tennessee, USA (named Suzy Abdelfarag [aka Suzzana, Mamur, Akema] who spoke "fluent" Arabic) asked me via Facebook to teach her Luganda (so that she could understand her favourite Ugandan musicians eg Jackie Chandiru who is a Lugbara-Ganda and Mowzey Radio). Dismissively, Suzy wanted more than just the basic words I started the lessons with, but while checking out a Luganda Dictionary at www.archive.org, I literally snapped without apologies because of what I had noticed about self-learning versus waiting for teachers to teach during my school career. Reinforced every year, Aiko's Lugbara Dictionary is where the Old and New meet (like Synthetic Imagination). It's a Lugbara Language Museum for historical, scientific and cultural research: Use Ctrl + F (key combination) or add this one-page electronic dictionary as a file to any AI chatbot to swiftly find any words you want! There is no English to Lugbara section, but you can try Data Augmentation (ie reverse-translate using an electronic Search tool when you want to find a Lugbara translation for the English word you already know). I'm only human and apologise in advance for any mistakes: I've cleaned thousands of errors by the way especially before Volume 10 (rationalised a lot spiritually and while proofreading spellings). I was even tempted to delete all the data, but resilience convinced me to keep polishing instead; therefore corrections and suggestions are always welcome through WhatsApp: +256-781-345712 or Email: aikoug@gmail.com! I ask the Holy Spirit to guide me in the name of JESUS (like Tower of Babel language multiplication by YHWH in Genesis 11 and Galileans filled with the Holy Spirit at Pentecost amazingly speaking other languages in Acts 2:1-13)! Every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that: JESUS Christ is Lord [YESU Kurisito ni Opi] (Philippians 2:10-11)!

Pronunciation Parameters:
In Lugbara phonology, every Lugbara word ends with one of the five vowels eg nyanya = tomato; mucele = rice; karoti = carrot; ovakedo = avocado; osu = bean. Letters Q [Kaya] and X [Ekasa, Alamakanda in Aringa dialect] are not used (meaning only 24 on a keyboard can do), but four unique ones with an apostrophe are added: 'B, 'D, 'W and 'Y (which all sound like putting H after them though personal names omit the apostrophe). The 28 letters in the Simplified Lugbara Alphabet sound like this: Ah, Ba, Bha, Cha, Da, Dha, Eh, Fa, Ga, Ha, Ii (as in Israel), Ja, Ka, La, Ma, Na, Oh, Pa, Ra, Sa, Ta, Uw (as in soUnd), Va, Wa, Wha, Ya, Yha, Za. One of the sweetest things about Lugbara is that words are pronounced the way they are written. Since nursery in Jinja (Busoga), I was confusingly taught to recite English vowels separately in a different acoustic compared to the vowels in the ABC to Z(ed) rhyme, but later realised that the former sequence was exactly how Lugbara vowels sound. Consonant clusters (with silent letter denoted by rounded brackets) in Lugbara are: (D)J, DR, (G)B, HW, (K)P, MB, M(G)B, MV, ND, NDR, NG, NY, NZ and TR while diphthong (vowel) clusters and other noteworthy phonetics include the following:

aa as in rat, for example leta-a

c as in church, for example Candiru (though can also be spelt Chandiru)

dj (letter D is silent) as in jilt, for example odji (pronounced oji)

ee (preferably single E instead of a long vowel) as in emblem, for example andree (also andre)

gb (letter G is silent) as in bend, for example Lugbara (pronounced Lubara)

ii as in import, for example 'di-i (also sometimes written as 'di'i with a glottal stop though archaic); letter I doesn't need to be repeated when noun is not being emphasized eg zii can just be zi, the second I stands for "the one (and only)"

kp (letter K is silent) as in pen, for example okpo (pronounced opo)

mv (letter M becomes N) as in conversation, for example omve (pronounced onve)

oa as in soar, for example Boroa

oo (preferably single O) as in hold, for example ocoo (also oco); not oo as in food

uu (preferably single U) as in chew, for example cuu (pronounced chu)

z (letter Z becomes J after N) as in jean, for example onzi (pronounced onji). Otherwise, most times remains z as in zebra, for example ozu and when the first letter of a word, for example zukulu.

The Old Vocabulary was small because some words have multiple meanings based on three major tones (to five including rising and falling), pronunciation or context eg o'du can mean day, thigh, omen, leopard; etc. However, the existing language which has a simplified 5-fold framework keeps getting New words added eg simu = phone; etc. Most nouns can denote both singular and plural (though adding yi after them also does); exceptions include mva [child] which becomes anzi [children]; etc while others are pronounced differently eg agu, agupi, etc. Adding suffixes -jo, -ko, -ru, -si and -yo to nouns creates new words; verbs also have -ku, -ma, -nga, -ta, -za and -zu. Adjectives follow the Subject eg buku eka = red book. In the entries ahead, semi-colon (;) shows different tones and meanings while goal brackets [ ] show translation. Lugbara sentences in past tense are structured using the Subject-Verb-Object arrangement like in English, but present continuous and future tenses follow S-O-V and ni [is] or nga [will, shall] may be added after the Subject to mark the difference eg YESU nga 'ba onzi pa [JESUS will save sinners]. When words are written together, the intended meanings may not change; so be very keen to spot the mashups eg Amanga votiyi 'be minira = Ama nga voti yi 'be mini ra [We will cast votes for you surely]. Short forms include: Ma mu ku = A mu ku [I'm not going]; Mi nya capati osu si = I nya capati osu si [You eat chapati with beans]; Eri ma mutuka = I-ma mutuka [His motorcar]...

Some words are borrowed or modified from English plus other languages like Swahili, Luganda, Lingala, etc. Lugbara words are often written the same way they are pronounced; repeated letters especially consonants look ambiguously redundant and can be reformed eg Vurra, Uleppi, Owaffa, Oluffe, Okollo, Ofudde, Mekki, etc unless very special and meaningful (What you see is what you hear [WYSIWYH]).

Marks for Simple Tones:
In English, some words have different spellings, but the same pronunciation eg chase/ chess; chat/ chart; hat/ heart/ hurt; lace/ less; load/ lord; mane/ men; son/ sun; etc. In Lugbara, the same spelling can have different pronunciations (hence meanings) based on three (to five including rising and falling) tones indicated by accents as below.

´ High tone eg aí [salt], drí [head], tí [cow];

- Mid tone eg aī [accept, pray], drī [hand], tī [strangle] (Mid tone is the most common tone in Lugbarati);

` Low tone eg aì [ask, beg], drì [(to) heat], tì [produce]...

Kalenda [Calendar]:
The simplest way to refer to months or moons [mba in Lugbara] is to use numbers, for example January is Mba alu, February is Mba iri not to be confused with July [Eri which is Mba aziri], May is Mba towi and so on. But below is the other latinized (and seasonal) way of mentioning them. The coming of each month used to help and still helps the Lugbara people to prepare what to plant in their gardens. This was and is done according to the months or seasons:

1. Yanuari (Oco Ko Pa Hwio, Oco 'Dupa Sere)

This is a term describing how "dogs which are seen running around lift up one of their front legs" due to the sweltering heat from the hot ground or soil. It is a period of no rain.

2. Feburuli (Kuluni)

Kulu is a locust grasshopper (but not Ise). It is a time of seeing young lads moving around with long sticks/ canes whose ends are strapped with sticky saps (from Laru tree) to trap/ catch the grasshoppers. In short, it is a time for catching grasshoppers. There is still no rain at this time. Intentional grass burning to prepare fields ready for tilling is rampant during this period. Sometimes grasses catch fire by themselves due to the intense sweltering heat.

3. Marici (Zengulu or Ndukulu)

This is when the sound of a distant thunder is heard. The start of the rainy season is approaching. 

4. Apirili (Ayi Ti)

This is the start of the wet season or spring with light rains still punctuated with sunny days. Groundnuts are planted in specially prepared gardens.

5. Mayi (Ayi Eti)

Also translates as "the back of the spring season" or the end of the spring season. It is a period when rains would halt temporarily and the hot sunny days return but not like the one in Oco ko pa hwio.

6. Yuni (Emveki)

The term literally means "Push On". It is a season of mild hunger and women get unripe millet (planted during Ayi Ti) from the gardens for making millet flour for porridge or for baking millet bread called "Anya Enya".

7. Yulayi (Eri)

The term Eri? or Iri means "After effects" of something. In this month, the after effects of the mild hunger during "Emveki" [June] are still present. The light rain during this period also encourages the farmers to plant beans.

8. Agosilo/ Agusito (Iripaku)

This is a term which mockingly looks back at the period of the mild hunger during the previous two months. It merely means "Hunger cannot retain its foothold forever". This is a time when the millet is ready and some sorghum interplanted with millet has almost matured for harvest. Pangs of hunger are disappearing. Here, groundnuts are harvested.

9. Sebitemba (Lokopere)

A season of eating raw quashed beans. Lokopere (or Loperete) is a traditional Lugbara dish made from quashed beans. Others call it Anguduru. At the start of this month, simsim is planted.

10. Okitoba (Abibi)

A period of delight when food is plenty. "Abibi" in colloquial Lugbarati merely means "Merry making". Drunkards are heard ululating here and there because millet, sorghum or corn brews are plenty. When they reach home, food is there waiting for them. 

11. Novemba (Waa)

This means a circle or a period. The period of ups and downs is almost over. Remember, colloquial Lugbarati uses a lot of paradoxes. Food is still in plenty and local brews are consumed as much as possible as if there is no tomorrow. It's called Musenene in Runyankore-Rukiga because of the peak season when grasshoppers fall.

12. Desemba (Anyu Ti)

Sometimes, it is referred to as "Anyu Fi (E)kuma". Literally, they are rejoicing about the ripe simsim in the gardens which are ready for harvest, that is "Bye bye to the tiny little simsim chaff" which they used to collect for making paste.

(NOTE: The concept of Enguli [a local potent cassava gin] was foreign to the Lugbara people; introduced by the Alur settlers. Others these days call it Camiya, Ngolito, Ola yi, Tapua, etc. The month descriptions are based on the upland Lugbarati dialect of Ayivu Muni, spoken southeast of Arua City)

Riddles (from "Lugbara Perception of Time" by Albert Titus Dalfovo): 
Do you know the name of the fat rat in the house finishing our groundnuts? The answer is the name of the boy who has stolen some food. 

Another riddle refers to a mushroom and asks for its name, which is that of some fearful boy. 

Another may ask for the name of a cat unable to catch rats or of a dog unable to chase anything, the name being that of a lazy boy. 

(The objective of riddles is ultimately to shape the future conduct of those whom the riddle is addressed to, generally boys and girls)

He is in P5. They were asked in Lugbarati to go back to school on Tuesday with the answers...// My Professor of Lugbarati (270224)..." - Derimah, on Friday 6th October 2023

"I used to love learning Lugbara language from your site but it has been blocked and can't access it anymore. Is there a new site where we can access that information?" - Felix Kuteesa via Wikipedia, on 15th August 2024 (I had changed the URL, but then reverted it)

"I contacted you in 2018 and I keep looking at your Lugbara blogs. Have you thought about writing a book? I have always wanted to know about our history, culture, language. I was born in Arua but grew up in Kakira - Jinja. Your blogs made me research and get old Lugbara textbooks... I bless GOD for your life. You are called to make Lugbara known to the world... If West Africans have language similarities to Lugbara, when did we separate... The Aringa connived with the Government to be called a tribe... Aringa is just a dialect. Not a tribe. Similar to Rigbo, Terego, etc... Difference is less than 100 words. I have travelled much of our land and analysed some of the various differences including being in Moyo and Adjumani. My paternal grandparents moved to Lodonga in Yumbe in the 1950s so all my mother's side are in Yumbe and speak Aringa. No difference... I admire the way our descendants will have access to all this information after the hardwork you are putting into this project..." - Gilbert Adima via WhatsApp, on Wednesday 11th December 2024 [while I was preparing to publish my Lugbara Dictionary on Amazon Kindle; submitted it three days later though drafted book cover on Sunday 8th December 2024 after a dream about Belinda Kakwanzi (Fundi Bots) and RS Elvis]

"Let’s design a powerful, foolproof plan to teach ChatGPT (the world’s largest language model) Lugbara properly, once and for all. It's really up to us. Bazungu won't do it for us. They've done it for their languages... This is all because no one or institution has bothered to input data for ChatGPT to consume in order to "understand" Lugbara. This leaves us behind and isolated. Some action has to be taken... We definitely need the input of Lugbara Kari in this... Otherwise your point about publishing Lugbara works on the internet is another way AI could access what it usually believes is authentic. But this alone could take an extended duration of time. We need a better shortcut..." - Paps Paps (Sunday 10th August 2025)

"(I')m conducting a research study on the vocabulary comparison between Teregoti and Ayivuti. My challenge is that... I didn't grow up in the community that could enable me learn my language.

Lugbara Supermobile (Lugbara Imagination):
Machines (Artificial Intelligence or AI) can be programmed to use Lugbara. Engineers, designers as well as Technology students in Ugandan schools eg Makerere University Kampala, Refactory, etc have always tinkered with this possibility. Machines can also teach or fine-tune themselves through Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) like I, Robot or Chappie, etc. Some great advancements towards this goal include the Lugbara Gboard (Next letter-prediction or automatic spelling-completion [auto-complete]/ correction) in Android phones plus mobile apps in Lugbarati eg Lugbara Bible, Ongo MUNGU Ni used in the Anglican Church of Uganda, etc; whoa! Below are translated commands you might see in the mega, super-smart Videophones of the future [Vidiosimu/ Supamobailu] or at a GSMA Mobile World Congress:

LOST IN TRANSLATION (Lugbara AI):
This encyclopedic research documentation is inspired by (and dedicated to) Cynthia Letasi, aka Rejoice (The Beautyful One [Roger that Ayi Kwei Armah] and Green Riding Hood [Now Mrs. Mungufeni] born on Thursday 17th August 1995) who changed my worldview like a valuable pearl (Matthew 13:45-46), worth far above rubies (Proverbs 31:10), Kumari in Nepal (Orient) or Divine Feminine between 2001-6; made me feel like Bob Harris in Arua (not Japan) around 2003 because she was 11 years younger than me, but inversely over four years ahead in speaking the language of the land we played on (If a snake, Balaam's donkey and parrots can talk, then how about stones?). This girl drained amalala ga kibuga [Luganda for: city haughtiness] out of me. To be honest, she was my first true "superhigh" crush within Arua (West Nile) after the Y2K Computer Bug Doom's Day didn't happen though I never told her my exact heartfelt reality for multiple years (Just tried to show it through kind, unapologetic treatment (loved her smile) until she confessed something unexpected, but very stunning directly to me that I will treasure until infinity). Cynthia engraved her fingerprints in my heart. Everytime I left Arua for campus in Mukono, I would feel my heart pain around Madi Okollo, but calm down in Nebbi Town. I adored how Xnthi's glowing eyes hawked at me (One of my favourite, unforgettable memories about her). Furthermore, her lookalikes included the volatile Tonto Dikeh (Nigerian), lyric-savvy Sheebah Karungi, decent Betty Mpologoma, unflinching Victoria Bagaya, worry-free Spice Diana as well as easygoing Scarlett Johansson who automatically became my all-time favourites; I knew her before all of them except maybe Betty who began her diamond singing career in 1999. Queenie, one of the lead vocalists in the Miracle Cathedral Rubaga (MCR) Proclaim Music choir also has that Cynthia aura plus Jommie Nankya, Pretty Banks, Sheila Gashumba, etc. Even though I reconnected with Xnthi (nickname I gave her meaning Numberless or Infinite value) via Facebook at the turn of the 2010s, I did not see her again physically until Tuesday 12th February 2019 walking southwards with her darkskinned female friend on the hyper-straight Arua Avenue at the Ediofe Road Junction (while I escorted my cousin to a printshop before he rushed to Onduparaka to see his sister). That was about 13 unlucky years since the last time, but only three surreal days after dreaming about her. I smiled like GOD's sun was shining on me in the afternoon before rush hour; it was the same day Onduparaka drew 0-0 with URA FC in the Ugandan top-flight league. Obsession is not a crime, just harness it like human solar electricity: Rise and shine! Disconnection is re-direction; too much love will heal you. Love is indestructible and the Greatest Thing: I admired Cynthia's pleasant appearance and shameless, supadupa fluency at a very tender age of 6 to 11 plus felt inspired to polish my own linguistics by reading Lugbara afresh since I learnt my mother tongue in Busoga (Birth to 11 years) and Buganda only by listening to Lugbara people talk despite being downgraded as backward or Lower class (Not Upper). Depression Management (Edification): Detach your mind and heart (Subconscious) from negative criticism, abuse, belittlement, mockery, disrespect, pokopoko or contempt! Even though I spoke and understood the language, I couldn't transcribe Lugbara well like English but when moonstruck by our Mt. Wati Road (Arua) neighbour's adorable brownskinned daughter, I was motivated to re-study this vernacular from Northwestern Uganda in black and white (scraping from music lyrics, Bibilia, Straight Talk newspapers, brochures, internet articles, other literature, then a Fountain Publishers 2009 dictionary compiled by Willy Ngaka, Edward O'du'bua and Paul Iga Ongua [bought for a Twenty10 gig from Sarah Ojirot at Uganda Deaf Women's Organisation; my Design Manager from UCU named Edmund Asingwire (Munyankole studying Business Administration) also hired me after campus to do artwork in Lugbara for him and Jolynn Investments Limited - One Nation under GOD], exclusively English dictionaries, a Chinese Dictionary for finding word classes, Google web searches for synonyms plus asked various people including my Parents and Facebook friends like Okitembeki Ndengendu [Enoch Opika Diku], etc). Consequently, I would perhaps grasp Lugbara the way ShaoLan Hsueh created Chineasy, then fabricate my own Synthetic Artificial Lugbara Technology (SALT), Informative Synthetic Encoder (ISE, the Grasshopper Translation Machine) or Ojapi Converter (Bypassing the Language Barrier). My big brother Victor Draman(i) Afayo (an I.T. Specialist based in KLA City) wanted to create a Lugbara.net website and gave me the assignment of doing research for him in the latter half of the 2000s; I decided to create my own Lugbara Culture blog (Amazing World of Lugbara) plus Facebook groups with the data around 2008, a process that inspired this vocabulary-book too. The words here are the ones used on UBC Radio (formerly Radio Uganda), Voice Of Life (probably since 1997 though I started listening in 2000), Arua One (since 2002), Koboko FM, Nile FM (since 2004), Radio Pacis, Access FM (since Monday 19th March 2018) plus BTN Television (from 2003), Westnile TV (from around 2020) and in voice commands for Airtel Uganda, et cetera. During one of the Mobile Monday sessions in KLA City, I asked a Google Executive from Germany who came to UG around 2012 if Lugbara could be added to the advanced Google Translate machine. He replied that he would forward my concern to the relevant office. Additionally, I posted a request at Wikimedia for a Lugbara Wiktionary but there weren't enough volunteer editors as is the requirement for the project to hatch; a Lugbarapedia would be the eventual outcome. Tualu.org [West Nile Portal] announced that they were working on a project of over 500 Lugbara words but I could not find their draft PDF. Nevertheless, Tualu posted a long and thorough Dictionary of Lugbara Personal Names by Alex Matua Asumi and his colleagues: Fortunate Drateru, Moses Dramiga and Proscovia Adrupiyo. There were no names listed with the letters H, Q and X, but the ones posted are more than enough; I commend them for that, a masterpiece about Ru'daza Lugbara niri (Naming in the Lugbara Tradition). Saidi Omar Dramani (Islamic University In Uganda - Mbale) also posted a PDF of his 2007 dissertation research for a Lugbarati Dictionary; it was very helpful. Fountain Publishers has Lugbarati Buku Anzini for Secondary School children, approved by Ministry of Education and Sports (MoES) plus National Curriculum Dvelopment Centre (NCDC) in Kyambogo. Language has to be preserved through documentation and transmitted to anyone connected or interested because cultural heritage represents a collective identity of values, diversity, traditions and assets passed around from generation to generation eg my Parents (James + Elizabeth Ndezo Dramani) to me, though my Mother departed in Twenty22 (during Volume 7) - She used to tell me: If you cannot express something in Lugbara, then use English! My father meanwhile said translation is difficult sometimes and I should be out with people to learn more, but still helped me find words quite well. Some relatives and natives would laugh at my pronunciations or choice of words but it didn't phase me. In Bantuland, I was never ashamed to be called Omulugwara even if it was a byword for stupidity, Naked People (Only Karamoja was ranked before us) and backwardness among some communities. Aren't we all descendants of Noah, the Flood Survivor? One day, I bypassed two dudes on Acacia Avenue in KLA and heard them speak what sounded like broken Lugbara; I reasoned later that it might have been Madi language. Also, Aringa is like Lugbara Patois, Pidgin or Filipino. During May 2023, someone asked me why I study Lugbara yet it is not useful and I told him not to belittle my mother tongue like that; garbage or waste appears worthless until it's recycled and given value or repackaged: Lugbara is a multinational language spoken mainly across three colonial borders which converge at Salia Musala (about 2 hours by car northwards from Arua City). There are nine Lugbara clans in DR Congo (Kari Culture Minister - John Godo, a UPC stalwart, taught me that in 2009: When I went to Ariwara [inside DRC] the following year, I was stunned by the amount of Lugbara songs playing loudly near the markets, more than Lingala or even English; many place names in Orientale Province as spotted on Google Maps look like Lugbara words). #SpeakLugbara on International Mother Tongue Day (21st February)! I strongly believe Generative AI can learn Lugbarati and make it reuseable and applicable in various fields; Deep Learning Indaba (DLI), Ambani, Masakhane (We Build Together) African Language NLP, Translators Without Borders (TWB), Artificial Intelligence for Development-Africa Network (AI4D-Africa), Hugging Face, Deep Site, Foundation for Lugbarati Development Initiative (FLUDI), Quantum ML or Lugbara GPT type-of-way. Live translation of President M7's speeches (by people like Nahori Oya, Fred Bada, John Ondoma, etc), social media broadcasts (eg Getrude Abiria [Oku aka], Peace Victoria Eyotaru, X. Pillo Hilarious who resembles Ham Jay animations, Baby Girl, etc) plus other arrangements such as crusades, conferences, weddings, funerals and so on can also be a reference... In December 2013, the Lugbarati Language Board proposed an Orthography Guide with 45 letters (including 7 vowels and 38 consonants). Tonal Lugbara literature with its many character symbols (accents, crosses, dashes or hyphens, dots, umlauts, etc) seems advanced plus crowdily complex (like the new books commissioned from DR Congo that I used to see at the Radio Pacis Printery) and scares away learners or researchers, but the simpler version shared in this wordbook is legit too... Lugbara funeral songs have been replaced with church hymns and modern Gospel music... In my Allegory of Artificial Ignorance: For machines to learn Lugbara, humans (both self-motivated and paid contributors) must train them or organise datasets for AI to decode unsupervised... Artificial Dreams (or Hallucinations) can also come true like Dreamcast... My makeshift Word Interchange Theory (WIT) from 1996 was not far-fetched afterall (feeling like Michael Jordan versus Detroit Pistons: No rules)...

When I was in Senior 5 (during 2001), I told my hostelmates that one day there will be a radio device that converts words spoken on air into text like S2T (Speech-2-Text) or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and displayed on a screen, not just lyrics as Jango Radio does, but conversations too (Inspired by the way we transcribed classroom dictation from teachers). I was labelled "mulalu [Luganda for: mad]" but dreams are not hopeless; GOD's time brings them to life for instance Google Assistant, Meet (In-chat captions), Apple's Siri, TranSay (My Favourite), Lingmo One2One, Translate 4 Me, Waverly Labs Pilot, Mesay, Langogo, Translaty, MUAMA Enence, Xiaomi AI Translator, Clik, WT2 Translator, Travis, LeTrans, Sigmo, NTT DoCoMo Translation Service, OBTranslate (from Nigeria), Logbar ili, OpenAI's ChatGPT or Whisper, Assembly AI, iFlytek, etc. Twitter (X) Spaces is also not very far from my Ongo (Ojapi Converter) vision. Zero-Shot Machine Translation tech is a model that can learn to translate words into another language without having to see any examples... Meta's Universal Speech Translator is a very ambitious AI research project that might improve language-mixing or Computer-Assisted Translation... LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) which Blake Lamoine labelled "sentient" was originally introduced as Meena in 2020. It's a conversational Large Language Model (LLM) built by Google... The Madi-Lugbara language is related to the languages of Southern Nigeria eg Yoruba, Igbo, Edo, Iduma, Igala, Igbira, Gbari and Nupe. In addition, we can include Ijo and Kalabari of the Niger Delta plus the Bariba - north of Yoruba and Aja (Ewe) spoken in Southern Dahomey (Benin), Togo and South-Eastern Ghana... Some people consider Lugbara a dialect of Madi but many do not accept this theory. In fact, a survey concluded that the Ogoko, Okollo and Rigbo dialects which are considered Southern Madi or Madi (I)ndri, should be categorised as dialects of Lugbara. Besides, we share the same names, numbers and many words. The only mother tongue interference I have heard from tribemates is mixing S with SH like when saying "soap" and "shop" or -TION with -SON eg "information" becomes "informason". Some interchange D with TH eg "together" is spoken as "togeder" while "three" may be pronounced "tiri" but most times, pronunciation is okay. Exactly 11 days before I created my electronic Lugbara Dictionary in Twenty16, Google Translate switched to Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) translating whole sentences at a time rather than piece by piece which GT used to do through Statistical Machine Translation since 28th April 2006. GNMT improves the Quality of Translation because it uses an Example-based Machine Translation (EBMT) in which the system learns from millions of examples... In 2020, with support from the Hewlett Foundation, Sunbird AI commenced the African language technology project. They created a large multilingual parallel text dataset of Ugandan languages, with translations in Acholi, Ateso, Luganda, Lugbara and Runyankole. On Saturday 11th October 2025, an AI Language Model called Sunflower (developed by Sunbird) was officially launched and it is described as "the ChatGPT for Uganda"... GeoPoll (a global research organisation) has datasets in Lugbara while JEHOVAH's Witnesses translate their publications into Lugbara (Available at www.jw.org). Companies like MTN, dfcu Bank, etc also use Lugbara in their PR content... It was very unreal to discover on Sunday 10th September 2023 while googling for "Lugbara AI" that the mother of Jeff Dean (55 year old Google AI Lead then) speaks "fluent Lugbara"; she lived in West Nile when Jeffrey was 5 years old. I guess she knows that Lugbara is learnable by machines; Meta introduced its own AI on WhatsApp a few days later. I love the fact that it paraphrases websites rejected by Wikipedia. Mark Zuckerberg believes AI will make superintelligent multi-lingual connections possible for all. When you copy some of the BigAMBO [Words] in this dictionary and paste as a chat message to Meta AI like a Paul and Silas jailbreak, it can learn Ugandan Lugbara by reading patterns and fine-tuning itself to chat with you even though it used a strange vocabulary as Lugbara in Twenty24 (probably Central or West African) like TranslatorMind the following year. Sam Altman (CEO at Open AI) also revealed that you can add knowledge and create a custom GPT by uploading files in the GPTs App Store. The Google.com AI Mode can fish out Lugbara words from throughout the internet and explain to you (Some are hallucinations, but others are spot on especially when it scrapes from bible translations). Self-Adapting or Adjusting LLMs (SEAL or SALMs) will learn new words by themselves. Teach AI to fish and it will fish all the fish-species to extinction... Push to the limits: Vibe-coding can also help you create Lugbara chatbots, games eg Scrabble or Pictionary plus other software for investors, traders, friends, lovers, in-laws, tourists, media watchers, music listeners, conference audiences, ethnodoxologists, migrants, refugees and those supertalented in Xenoglossy... The ISO 639-3 Language Code for Lugbara is lgg while the Glottocode is lugb1240, but I wish the language code for Lugbara was simply Lbr (which is my original Lugbara Dictionary logo in a circle); it corresponds better though already taken by Lohorung language (endangered Sino-Tibetan language spoken in Nepal). The quick, brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!
