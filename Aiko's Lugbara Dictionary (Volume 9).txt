Pronunciation Parameters [Lugbara Phonology]:
Created painstakingly from scratch with gritty nerves on the 3rd Agofe's 90th birthday afternoon (Saturday 26th November 2016) and reinforced plus cleaned every year, Aiko's Lugbara Dictionary is where the Old and New meet. I'm only human and apologise in advance for any mistakes. So, corrections and suggestions are most welcome via WhatsApp: +256-781-345712 or Email: aikoug@gmail.com! I ask the Holy Spirit to guide me in the name of JESUS! 

Every Lugbara word ends with one of the five vowels eg nyanya = tomato; mucele = rice; karoti = carrot; ovakedo = avocado; osu = bean. Letters Q [Kya] and X [Eksa, Alamakanda in Aringa dialect] are not used but four unique ones with an apostrophe are added: 'B, 'D, 'W and 'Y (which all sound like putting H after them though personal names omit the apostrophe). The 28 letters in the Simplified Lugbara Alphabet sound like this: Ah, Ba, Bha, Cha, Da, Dha, Eh, Fa, Ga, Ha, Ii (as in Inn), Ja, Ka, La, Ma, Na, Oh, Pa, Ra, Sa, Ta, Uw (as in yoU), Va, Wa, Wha, Ya, Yha, Za. The original Vocabulary was small because some words have multiple meanings based on three major tones (to five including rising and falling), pronunciation or context eg ai can mean salt (high tone); accept, pray (mid tone); ask (low tone) while ti can mean cow; to drip; mouth, language; to produce and so on. However, new words keep being added to the existing language eg komputa = computer; simu = phone; etc. Most nouns can denote both singular and plural (though adding yi after them also does); exceptions include mva [child] which becomes anzi [children]; etc. Adding suffixes -jo, -ko, -ru, -si and -yo to nouns creates new words; verbs also have -ku, -ma, -nga, -ta, -za and -zu. Adjectives follow the Subject eg buku eka = red book. In the entries ahead, semi-colon (;) shows different tones and meanings while goal brackets [] show translation. Lugbara sentences in past tense are structured using the Subject-Verb-Object arrangement like in English, but present continuous and future tenses follow S-O-V though nga [will, shall] is added after the Subject to mark the difference eg YESU ni (nga) 'ba onzi pa [JESUS (will) save sinners]...

Some words are borrowed or modified from English and other languages like Swahili, Luganda and Lingala. Lugbara words are written the same way they are pronounced; repeated letters look redundant eg Vurra, Oluffe, Ofudde, Owaffa, Mekki, etc unless special and meaningful (What you see is what you get). Diphthong clusters and other noteworthy phonetics include the following:

a as in rat, for example leta-a

c as in church, for example Candiru (though can also be spelt Chandiru)

dj (letter D is silent) as in jilt, for example odji (pronounced oji)

ee (preferably single E) as in emblem, for example andree (also andre)

gb (letter G is silent) as in bend, for example Lugbara (pronounced Lubara)

i as in inn, for example 'di-i (also sometimes written as 'di'i though archaic) 

kp (letter K is silent) as in pen, for example okpo (pronounced opo)

mv (letter M becomes N) as in converse, for example omve (pronounced onve)

oa as in soar, for example Boroa

oo as in hold, for example ocoo (also oco), not oo as in mood

u as in food, for example o'du

uu as in chew, for example cuu (pronounced chu)

z (letter Z becomes J after N) as in jean, for example onzi (pronounced onji). Otherwise, most times remains z as in zebra, for example ozu and when the first letter of a word, for example zukulu.


Marks for Simple Tones:
´ High tone eg tí [cow];

- Mid tone eg tī [strangle] (Mid tone is the most common tone in Lugbarati);

` Low tone eg tì [give birth]...

Six days you shall labour; but the seventh day is a sabbath to the LORD your GOD; in it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your manservant, or your maidservant, or your cattle, or the sojourner who is within your gates; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day; therefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it]

5. Mi inzi mi ati pi mi andri be, ewu mini ma ovu ani izu angu YEHOVA MUNGU minirini fele mi driri ma alia [Honour your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the LORD your GOD gives you]

Kalenda [Calendar]:
The simplest way to refer to months or moons [mba in Lugbara] is to use numbers, for example January is Mba alu, February is Mba iri not to be confused with July [Eri which is Mba aziri], May is Mba towi and so on. But below is the other latinized (and seasonal) way of mentioning them. The coming of each month used to help and still helps the Lugbara people to prepare what to plant in their gardens. This was and is done according to the months or seasons:

1. Januari (Oco Ko Pa Hwio, Oco 'Dupa Sere)

This is a term describing how "dogs which are seen running around lift up one of their front legs" due to the sweltering heat from the hot ground or soil. It is a period of no rain.

2. Feburuli (Kuluni)

Kulu is a locust grasshopper (but not Ise). It is a time of seeing young lads moving around with long sticks/ canes whose ends are strapped with sticky saps (from Laru tree) to trap/ catch the grasshoppers. In short, it is a time for catching grasshoppers. There is still no rain at this time. Intentional grass burning to prepare fields ready for tilling is rampant during this period. Sometimes grasses catch fire by themselves due to the intense sweltering heat.

3. Marici (Zengulu or Ndukulu)

This is when the sound of a distant thunder is heard. The start of the rainy season is approaching. 

4. Aprili (Ayi Ti)

This is the start of the wet season. Literally translates into "The mouth of the wet spring season" or the beginning of the spring season with light rains still punctuated with sunny days. Groundnuts are planted in specially prepared gardens.

5. Mayi (Ayi Eti)

Also translates as "the back of the spring season" or the end of the spring season. It is a period when rains would halt temporarily and the hot sunny days return but not like the one in Oco ko pa hwio.

6. Juni (Emveki)

The term literally means "Push On". It is a season of mild hunger and women get unripe millet (planted during Ayi Ti) from the gardens for making millet flour for porridge or for baking millet bread called "Anya Enya".

7. Julayi (Eri)

The term Eri? or Iri means "After effects" of something. In this month, the after effects of the mild hunger during "Emveki" [June] are still present. The light rain during this period also encourages the farmers to plant beans.

8. Agoslo/ Agusito (Iripaku)

This is a term which mockingly looks back at the period of the mild hunger during the previous two months. It merely means "Hunger cannot retain its foothold forever". This is a time when the millet is ready and some sorghum interplanted with millet has almost matured for harvest. Pangs of hunger are disappearing. Here, groundnuts are harvested.

9. Sebitemba (Lokopere)

A season of eating raw quashed beans. Lokopere (or Loperete) is a traditional Lugbara dish made from quashed beans. Others call it Anguduru. At the start of this month, simsim is planted.

10. Okitoba (Abibi)

A period of delight when food is plenty. "Abibi" in colloquial Lugbarati merely means "Merry making". Drunkards are heard ululating here and there because millet, sorghum or corn brews are plenty. When they reach home, food is there waiting for them. 

11. Novemba (Waa)

This means a circle or a period. The period of ups and downs is almost over. Remember, colloquial Lugbarati uses a lot of paradoxes. Food is still in plenty and local brews are consumed as much as possible as if there is no tomorrow.

12. Desemba (Anyu Ti)

Sometimes, it is referred to as "Anyu Fi (E)kuma". Literally, they are rejoicing about the ripe simsim in the gardens which are ready for harvest, that is "Bye bye to the tiny little simsim chaff" which they used to collect for making paste.

(NOTE: The concept of Enguli [a local potent cassava gin] was foreign to the Lugbara people; introduced by the Alur settlers. Others these days call it Camiya, Ngolito, Ola yi, Tapua, etc. The month descriptions are based on the upland Lugbarati dialect of Ayivu Muni, spoken southeast of Arua City)

The booklet entitled "The Hidden Wisdom of Lugbara-Aringa" features 116 Proverbs. A copy used to cost 10,000 UGX from Rasul Bombasa (+256-779-496927).

Riddles (from "Lugbara Perception of Time" by Albert Titus Dalfovo): 
Do you know the name of the fat rat in the house finishing our groundnuts? The answer is the name of the boy who has stolen some food. 

Another riddle refers to a mushroom and asks for its name, which is that of some fearful boy. 

Another may ask for the name of a cat unable to catch rats or of a dog unable to chase anything, the name being that of a lazy boy. 

(The objective of riddles is ultimately to shape the future conduct of those whom the riddle is addressed to, generally boys and girls)

Lugbara Supermobile:
Machines (AI or Artificial Intelligence) can be programmed to use Lugbara. Engineers, Designers as well as Technology Students in Ugandan Schools have always tinkered with this Possibility. Machines can also teach themselves Lugbara through Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI). Some great advancements towards this goal include the Lugbara Gboard in Android phones plus mobile apps in Lugbarati; whoa! Below are translated Commands you might see in the mega, super-smart Videophones of the future [Vidiosimu/ Supamobailu] or at a GSMA Mobile World Congress:

LOST IN TRANSLATION (like Leta SI [Synthetic Imagination]):
This Lugbara Dictionary research documentation is inspired by (and dedicated to) Cynthia Letasi, aka Rejoice (The Beautyful One and Green Riding Hood born on Thursday 17th August 1995; now Mrs. Mungufeni) who changed my worldview like a Kumari in the Orient or Divine Feminine between 2001-6; made me feel like Bob Harris in Arua. To be honest, she was my first true superhigh crush within Arua (West Nile) though I never told her my exact reality for years (just tried to show it through countless, unapologetic actions until she boldly confessed something I will treasure until infinity) plus resembles Tonto Dikeh (Nigerian), Sheebah Karungi and Betty Mpologoma as well as Spice Diana who automatically became my all-time favourites. Queenie, one of the lead vocalists in Miracle Cathedral Rubaga's Proclaim Music choir also has that Cynthia aura plus Pretty Banks, Sheila Gashumba, etc. Even though I reconnected with Xnthi via Facebook at the turn of the 2010s, I did not see her again until Tuesday 12th February 2019 on the hyper-straight Arua Avenue at the Ediofe Road Junction walking southwards with a darkskinned female friend, three days after dreaming about her. I smiled like the sun was shining on me in the afternoon before rush hour; it was the same day Onduparaka drew 0-0 with URA FC. Obsession is not a crime, just harness it like human solar electricity. Rejection or Disconnection is Redirection; too much love will heal you. Love is infinite and the Greatest Thing: I admired Cynthia's supadupa fluency at a very tender age of 6-11 and felt inspired to polish my own linguistics by reading Lugbara afresh since I learnt my mother tongue in Busoga (Birth to 11 years) and Buganda only by listening to Lugbara people talk. Even though I spoke and understood it, I couldn't transcribe Lugbara well like English but when I met our Mt. Wati Road (Arua) neighbour's adorable brownskinned daughter, I was motivated to re-study this vernacular from northwestern Uganda in black and white (using music lyrics, Biblia, other literature, then a Fountain Publishers 2009 dictionary compiled by Willy Ngaka, Edward O'du'bua and Paul Iga Ongua [bought for a Twenty10 gig from Sarah Ojirot at Uganda Deaf Women's Organisation], etc). Consequently, I would perhaps grasp Lugbara the way ShaoLan Hsueh created Chineasy, then fabricate my own Synthetic Artificial Lugbara Technology (SALT), Informative Synthetic Encoder (ISE) and Ojapi Converter. Language has to be preserved through documentation and transmitted to anyone connected or interested because cultural heritage represents a collective identity of values, diversity, traditions and assets passed around from generation to generation eg my parents (James + Elizabeth Dramani) to me. Some relatives and natives would laugh at my pronunciations or choice of words but it didn't phase me. I've never been ashamed to be called Omulugwara even if it is a byword for stupidity, Naked People and backwardness among some communities. Aren't we descendants of Noah, the Flood Survivor? One day, I bypassed two dudes on Acacia Avenue in KLA and heard them speak what sounded like broken Lugbara; I reasoned later that it might have been Madi language. Also, Aringa is like Lugbara Patois or Filipino. During May 2023, someone asked me why I study Lugbara yet it is not useful and I told him not to diss my mother tongue like that; garbage or waste appears worthless until it's recycled and given value: Lugbara is a multinational language spoken mainly across three colonial borders which converge at Salia Musala (about 2 hours by car northwards from Arua City). There are nine Lugbara clans in DR Congo. I strongly believe Generative AI can learn Lugbarati and make it reuseable and applicable in various fields; Deep Learning Indaba (DLI), Hugging Face, Foundation for Lugbarati Development Initiative (FLUDI) or Lugbara GPT type-of-way. Live translation of President M7's speeches by people like Fred Bada plus other arrangements like crusades, etc can also be a reference... In December 2013, the Lugbarati Language Board proposed an Orthography Guide with 45 letters (including 7 vowels and 38 consonants). Tonal Lugbara literature with its many character symbols (accents, crosses, dashes, dots, umlauts, etc) seems advanced plus crowdily complex and scares away learners, but the simpler version shared in this wordbook is legit too... Lugbara funeral songs have been replaced with church hymns... In my Allegory of Artificial Ignorance: For machines to learn Lugbara, humans (both self-motivated and paid contributors) must train them or organise datasets for AI to decode unsupervised... Artificial Dreams (or Hallucinations) can also come true like Dreamcast... My makeshift Word Interchange Technique (WIT) from 1996 was not far-fetched afterall (feeling like Michael Jordan versus Detroit Pistons)...

When I was in Senior 5 (during 2001), I told my hostelmates that one day there will be a radio device that converts words spoken on air into text like S2T (Speech-2-Text) and displayed on a screen. I was labelled "mulalu [Luganda for: mad]" but dreams are not hopeless; GOD's Time brings them to life for instance Google Assistant, Meet (In-chat captions), Apple's Siri, TranSay, Logbar ili, OpenAI's ChatGPT or Whisper, etc. Twitter (X) Spaces is also not very far from my Ongo (Ojapi Converter) vision. Zero-Shot Machine Translation tech is a model that can learn to translate words into another language without having to see any examples... Meta's Universal Speech Translator is a very ambitious AI research project that might improve language-mixing or Computer-Assisted Translation like Google Translate does... LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications) which Blake Lamoine labelled "sentient" was originally introduced as Meena in 2020. It's a conversational Large Language Model (LLM) built by Google... The Madi-Lugbara language is related to the languages of Southern Nigeria eg Yoruba, Igbo, Edo, Iduma, Igala, Igbira, Gbari and Nupe. In addition, we can include Ijo and Kalabari of the Niger Delta plus the Bariba - north of Yoruba and Aja (Ewe) spoken in Southern Dahomey (Benin), Togo and South-Eastern Ghana... Some people consider Lugbara a dialect of Madi but many do not accept this theory. In fact, a survey was conducted and it concluded that the Ogoko, Okollo and Rigbo dialects (which are considered Southern Madi) should be categorised as dialects of Lugbara. Besides, we share the same names, numbers and many words... In 2020, with support from the Hewlett Foundation, Sunbird AI commenced the African language technology project. They created a large multilingual parallel text dataset of Ugandan languages, with translations in Acholi, Ateso, Luganda, Lugbara and Runyankole... GeoPoll (Research organisation) also has datasets in Lugbara while JEHOVAH's Witnesses translate their publications into Lugbara (Available at www.jw.org)... It was very unreal to discover on Sunday 10th September 2023 while googling for "Lugbara AI" that the then 55 year old Google AI Lead Jeff Dean's mother speaks "fluent Lugbara"; she lived in West Nile when Jeffrey was 5 years old. I guess she knows that Lugbara is learnable by machines; Meta introduced its own AI on WhatsApp a few days later. I love the fact that it paraphrases websites rejected by Wikipedia. Mark Zuckerberg believes AI will make superintelligent multi-lingual connections possible for all. When you copy some of the BigAMBO [Words] in this dictionary and paste as a chat message to Meta AI, it can learn Ugandan Lugbara by storing patterns and fine-tuning itself even though it used a strange vocabulary as Lugbara in Twenty24 (probably Central or West African)...
